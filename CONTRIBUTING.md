## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use ES6+ features
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await over callbacks

### Code Formatting

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Maximum line length: 120 characters

Example:
```javascript
// Good
async function loadFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
    return { success: true, content };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load file:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```

### React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use meaningful prop names
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types (future)

### Electron Guidelines

- Always use contextBridge for IPC
- Never expose Node.js APIs directly to renderer
- Handle errors gracefully
- Add appropriate security headers

## Testing

Currently, the project doesn't have a test suite configured. We welcome contributions to set up testing infrastructure using:
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Spectron or Playwright for E2E tests

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git rebase main
   ```

3. Push your changes:

   ```

4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
